# ASSIGNMENT 2
The goal is to achieve concurrent programming using Python. This project shows you the two ways of parallelising tasks, in which you have to improve the speed of the serial-programming application by using threading and/ or multiprocessing.


There are many options for multithreading and multiprocessing.

Some of these packages are, but not limited to:

Ray

Numba

Modin

Dask

multiprocessing

threading

concurrent.futures


In my project I used threading for multi-threading the task of downloading images and used multi-processing for the resizing images task.
